## Loading plugins for development

Inside the saifu folder, navigate to the folder `plugins`, or create it if it doesn't exist yet. 

Create a new sub-folder with your plugin name and copy the contents of your built plugin bundle (manifest.json + main.js)

### Hints:
- Symlink or setup your plugin environment to automatically generate these files and put them into the right place
- Inject sourcemaps into the bundle for easier development
